      <p>The website has been created to provide the Logan Glass family with a way to share information about the 2021 Logan Glass Reunion. </p>
      <p>Apart from the reunion, this website allows our family to share memories. Some of my favorite memories are with my cousins are at the annual family reunions.  It is the one-time in the year that everyone can come together and reminisce about times in my grandmothers yard and hiding from bats under the light pole. </p>
      <p>The family is also looking to update some technology and begin to use online registration so that we can have up-to-date contact information for the members within the family.  This site is geared to confirm attendence, accept payment, and contain reunion information. </p>
      <p>We invite you to get involved with the reunion activities. Reconnect with cousins you haven't seen in years and meet the new generations of cousins. </p>
