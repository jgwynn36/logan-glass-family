# logan-glass-family

The Logan Glass family would like a website for communication about upcoming events and reunion information.

## Motivation

For the past 5 years I have worked with some of my family members on planning an exciting weekend for the family to fellowship.  As our members continue to get younger I wanted to add ways that we can communicate through out the year by using 1 website and not multiple social medias that some of our elder members may not use.  

Last year I transitioned into a developer due to some new course work I completed and thought that putting some of my spare time to build something for my family would be a great idea. My current employer uses vue.js apps as a new tech stack and this was a great project to work on for me.
